HIP on HLL: Approximate Distinct Counter
========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iwiwi/hip-hyperloglog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iwiwi/hip-hyperloglog)

This is a C++ implementation of the modern approximate distinct counter which adopts the *Historic Inverse Probability estimator (HIP)* on the *HyperLogLog counter* (*k*-partition Minwise Hashing with base-2 ranks).

Currently under development.
